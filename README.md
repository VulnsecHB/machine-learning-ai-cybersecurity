# Machine Learning & AI in Cybersecurity 🤖🔐

Official code repository for the Udemy course:  
**Machine Learning & AI in Cybersecurity: Build 20+ Projects**

----------------------------------------

## 📌 Repository Purpose
This repository contains all **source code examples and projects** used throughout the course.

The structure of the repository mirrors the **Udemy section structure**, making it easy to follow along
with the lectures and access the correct code for each topic.

------------------------------------------

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a **course section**.

Section-7/
Section-8/
Section-9/
Section-10/
Section-11/

Inside each section folder, you will find **Python (`.py`) files**, where:
- Each file corresponds to a **specific concept, example, or project**
- Filenames are descriptive of what is implemented (e.g. clustering, vectorization, detection)

Example:
Section-9/
├── Clustering.py
├── KMeans_example.py

-------------------------------------

## 🎓 How to Use This Repository
1. Open the relevant section in the Udemy course
2. Navigate to the matching `Section-X` folder in this repository
3. Open or download the `.py` file related to the lecture
4. Run, modify, and experiment with the code locally

This approach is intentional and keeps the repository simple and practical.

---------------------------------------

## 🛠 Requirements
Most examples require:
- Python 3.x
- Common ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)

Any additional requirements are explained during the lectures.
